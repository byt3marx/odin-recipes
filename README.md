/*Learned that when applying the background image you have to consider:
- if your html css and image are all in the same directory use:
  mp_background.jpg, no quotes and no forward slashes
- however if you css or image are in subdirectories of where your html lives, you'll want to make sure you correctly path:
background-image: url(../img/mp_background.jpg); in this case css and image live in subdirectories
background-image: url(img/mp_background.jpg) css lives with html but img is a subdirectory*/
