    <p>It's a new, yummy twist on gnocchi! You'll find the ingredients and steps on how to make it, below.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 pound sweet potatoes</li>
      <li>1 large egg</li>
      <li>1 clove garlic, pressed</li>
      <li>&frac12 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>&frac12 teaspoon ground nutmeg or to taste</li>
      <li>2 cups all-purposed flour, or as needed</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
      <li>Bake sweet potatoes in the preheated oven until soft to the touch, about 30 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool, 15 to 30 minutes.</li>
      <li>Remove and discard skins from cooled potatoes. Mash flesh in a large bowl or press through a ricer. 
        Blend in egg, garlic, salt and nutmeg. Mix in flour, a little at a time, until a soft dough forms.</li>
      <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil.</li>
      <li>While the water is comming to a boil, make the gnocchi: Roll dough on a floured surface into several long, snake-like logs.
        Cut logs into 1-inch pieces.</li>
      <li>Drop dough pieces into boiling water and cook until they float to the surface. Transfer with a slotted spoon to a serving dish
        and keep warm until ready to serve.</li>
    </ol>
